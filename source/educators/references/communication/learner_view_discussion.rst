.. _A Students View of the Discussion:

**********************************
A Learner's View of the Discussion
**********************************

When you add a discussion component to a unit, in the LMS, learners see only
the discussion, together with the display name of the discussion component, the category, and the subcategory. EdX recommends that you add an HTML
component before each discussion component where you add some text to
introduce the discussion topic.

In the following example, the discussion component follows an HTML
component. Learners select **Add a Post** to post their own contributions.

      in the LMS.

Content-specific topics that you add using discussion components are included
on the course **Discussion** page in the same way as course-wide discussion
topics as included. In the following example, the category (1) and the
subcategory (2) of the discussion component is shown in the list of
discussion topics.
