.. _Testing Your Course Content:

###########################
Testing Your Course Content
###########################

The way your course looks in Studio is different from the way that learners
will see and experience it when it is live in the LMS. As a best practice, you
should test content continually as you build your course, by interacting with
the course content from a learner's point of view.

The method that you choose for experiencing the course content as a learner
depends on the publishing status of the content.

* For published and released content, use :ref:`View Live<View Published
  Content>`.

* For draft and unreleased content, use :ref:`Preview<Preview Unpublished
  Content>`.

For more information, see the following topics.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

Beta testing your course is another way to evaluate course content. For
information about setting up a beta test for your course, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.

To test content before a course has started, you can add yourself as a beta
tester on the instructor dashboard. Make sure to set the course start date and
the appropriate **Days Early for Beta** value. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.


.. _View Published Content:

**************************************
Viewing Published and Released Content
**************************************

If your course has started, you can view published and released course content
from the point of view of a learner. When you select **View Live** or **View
Live Version** from the course outline in Studio, you can choose specific views
in the LMS to experience the course content exactly as a particular learner
would.

.. note:: For courses that have not started, **View Live** mode provides only
   **Staff** view, and you can only view content that has a publishing
   status of Published.

In courses that have started, when you use **Staff** view in **View Live**
mode, keep the following points in mind.

* In addition to units that have a publishing status of :ref:`published and
  live<Published and Live>` you also see units that are published but not yet
  released.

* You see published units that are in :ref:`Visible to Staff Only` or
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` status, regardless of the release dates of
  the containing section or subsection, but you see only the latest published
  version of such units.

* You do not see units that are in :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` status. To
  see these units, you must use Preview mode, as described in :ref:`Preview
  Unpublished Content`.

* If you view the course in a role other than **Staff**, you do not have
  access to the **Instructor** tab or to staff functions such as **View Unit in
  Studio**, **Staff Debug Info**, or **Submission History**.

For information about unit publishing statuses, see :ref:`Unit Publishing
Status`.

========================================
View Published and Released Content
========================================

To view published and released content as it would appear to members of
different groups, follow these steps.

#. From the Studio **Course Outline** page, select **View Live**.
   Alternatively, from a unit page, select **View Live Version**.

   A separate browser tab opens for the course in the LMS.

#. In the LMS, select one of the **View this course as** options, as described
   in :ref:`Roles for Viewing Course Content`.

The course view refreshes to present published course content as a learner in
the selected group would see it.

For more information about each view, see :ref:`Staff View`, :ref:`Student
View`, or :ref:`Specific Student View`. For more information about viewing
cohort-specific course content, see :ref:`Viewing Cohort Specific Courseware`.


.. _Preview Unpublished Content:

************************
Previewing Draft Content
************************

Before your course has started, or before you release content to learners, you
can test how the content will appear when it is released.

Similar to :ref:`viewing published content<View Published Content>`, you can
choose specific views in the LMS to experience draft or unreleased course
content as learners belonging to different groups would, but you select
**Preview** from the course outline in Studio instead of **View Live**.

In **Preview** mode, if you use one of the student-based **View course as**
options, you can see draft course content unrestricted by release date. You
see any content that has a publishing status of :ref:`Published and Live` as
well as content with publishing statuses of :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` or
:ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`.

When you use **Staff** view in preview mode, you also see any content that is
:ref:`Visible to Staff Only`.


=============================
Preview Draft Content
=============================

To preview draft content and see how it would appear to members of different
groups when it is released, follow these steps.

#. From a unit page in the **Course Outline** in Studio, select **Preview**.

   A separate browser tab opens for the course in the LMS.

#. In the LMS, select one of the **View this course as** options, as described
   in :ref:`Roles for Viewing Course Content`.

The course view refreshes to present course content as it is currently
configured in Studio, and as a learner in the selected group would see it.

.. note:: If you use randomized content blocks in your course, you cannot
   preview unpublished units that contain content from randomized content
   blocks, because the randomized content is not assigned until after the unit
   is published. For information about viewing the actual content that has
   been assigned to a particular learner from a randomized content block in a
   live course, see :ref:`Specific Student View`.
