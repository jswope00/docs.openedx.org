Overview
**********

You can configure a :ref:`subsection <Developing Course Subsections>`
in your course so that learners have a set amount of time to complete and
submit all problems in that subsection.

Although you can configure an ungraded subsection to be timed, typically you set
a time limit on graded subsections, such as for mid-term or final exams.

When learners take a timed exam, a timer on the exam page counts down and
provides alerts as the time limit approaches. When no time remains, learners
can no longer access additional exam content, or submit additional responses
to the subsection. All problems that were completed are graded. No points are
awarded for unsubmitted problems.

Course teams can grant individual learners more time to complete problems in
the subsection, but only if learners request additional time **before**
starting a timed exam.

.. note::
  Learners cannot complete timed exams using the edX mobile app.

To better understand the learner's experience of timed exams, see
`taking_timed_exams`_ in the *edX Learner's Guide* or
`taking_timed_exams`_ in the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

  Timed exams are different from :ref:`proctored exams<CA_ProctoredExams>`.
  While both types of exams have a time limit, learners are monitored only
  during proctored exams.
