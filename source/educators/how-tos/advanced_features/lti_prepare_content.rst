Create a Duplicate Course for LTI use

.. tags:: educator, how-to

.. note:: This feature was a closed pilot experiment. This feature is not
 supported for new users.

Before you create a duplicate course, be sure to check with your DevOps team
to determine the website that hosts your organization's courses for LTI use.

To create the duplicate course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, export the original course. For more information, see
   :ref:`Export a Course`.

#. In Studio on your organization's host site for LTI courses, create a course.
   This is the duplicate course.

   .. note:: If your organization uses the same site as the host for both the
    original course and for LTI courses, be sure to give the duplicate course a
    different name or run.

#. In the duplicate course, import the tar.gz file that you exported in step 1.
   For more information, see :ref:`Import a Course`.

.. future: add re-run as an option for sites that host courses for LTI on the same instance (edit from Mark, Phil says re-run should work). - Alison 1 Sep 2015

*******************************
Verify Content Status
*******************************

Only edX course content that is published appears in an external LMS.

.. note:: The **Hide from students** setting for sections, subsections,
 and units does not affect the visibility of content in an external LMS. Only
 the publication status of a unit can prevent content from being included.

To verify that all of the content in your edX course is published, follow these
steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Outline**. The **Course
   Outline** page opens.

#. Expand each section and subsection.

#. Locate units with "Unpublished units will not be released" or "Unpublished
   changes to live content" below the unit name.

#. For each unpublished unit, make any changes that are necessary to prepare
   the content for publication. Alternatively, delete the unit.

#. Publish the unit. For more information, see :ref:`Publish a Unit`.
