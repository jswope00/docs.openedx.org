    This information applies only to courses that run on Edge. For courses that

    **You only enter information in Studio if information changes after the
    course run About page is published.** For more information, see
    `Pub Change a Course Run`_.

For courses that run on Edge, you create courses and course runs entirely in
Studio. You also add course staff and specify other optional information in
Studio.
