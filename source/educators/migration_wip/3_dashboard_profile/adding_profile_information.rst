Adding Profile Information
***************************

Your personal profile allows you to optionally share information about yourself
with other participants in the courses that you take. If you choose to add
profile information, course teams and other learners in your courses can view
the information that you share.

You can share either a limited profile or a full profile.

  .. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, your limited profile only
     includes your username. You cannot add a profile picture.

* A limited profile shares only your username. You can also add a profile
  picture, if you are over 13 years of age.

Add or Update a Limited Profile
================================

A limited profile includes only your username and, optionally, an image.

.. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, your limited profile only includes
   your username. You cannot add a profile picture.

To add or update a limited profile, follow these steps.


#. At the top of any page, select **Dashboard** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username, then select the **Profile** tab.

#. (optional) Add an image that you want to associate with your username.
   Your image must be a .gif, .jpg, or .png file. The image must be between
   100 bytes and 1 MB in size. If you do not add an image, the placeholder
   image appears as your profile image.

   #. Move your cursor over the placeholder image, and click **Upload an
      image**.

      use as your profile image, and then click **Open**.

   To change or remove your profile image, move your cursor over your image,
   and then select either **Change image** or **Remove**. When you remove your
   profile image, the placeholder image appears as your profile image.

The site saves your changes automatically.


================================
Add or Update a Full Profile
================================

.. note:: You must specify your year of birth on the **Account Settings** page
   before you can share a full profile. If you are under 13 years of age, you
   can share only a `Create or Edit a Limited Profile`_.

If you create a full profile, you share the following information in
addition to your username and profile image.

* Your full name.

* Your location.

* Your language.

* A paragraph about yourself. You might include your interests, goals, or
  other information that you want to share. This paragraph can contain up to
  300 characters.

* Links to your personal social media accounts.

To add or update your profile, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select **Dashboard** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username, then select the **Profile** tab.

#. In the header area of your profile page, for **Profile Visibility**, select
   **Full Profile**.

#. (optional) Add a profile image.

   Your image must be a .gif, .jpg, or .png file that is less than 1 MB in
   size. If you do not add an image, the placeholder image appears as your
   profile image.

   #. Move your cursor over the placeholder image, and click **Upload an
      image**.

   #. In the file navigation window, select the image file that you want to
      use as your profile image, and then click **Open**.

   To change or remove your profile image, move your cursor over your image,
   and then select either **Change image** or **Remove**. When you remove your
   profile image, the placeholder image appears as your profile image.

#. On your profile page, move your cursor over the information that you want
   to change.

#. Click inside the field to choose an option from the list, or enter text.

The site saves your changes automatically.

.. note:: If you change your profile type from **Full Profile** to **Limited
   Profile**, your full name, location, language, and descriptive paragraph
   are no longer visible on your profile page. However, this information is
   saved, and becomes visible again to other learners and course teams if you
   change your profile back to **Full Profile**.

=================================================
Add Links to Your Personal Social Media Accounts
=================================================

If you select the **Full Profile** option, you can add social media icons on
your profile that link to your personal Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn account
pages.

To add links to your social media accounts to your profile, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select **Account** from the dropdown menu icon next
   to your username.

#. On the **Account Settings** page, under **Social Media Links**, enter
   either your username or the URL to the profile page for each social media
   account that you want to add to your profile.

   For example, if your Facebook username is ``edx``, you can enter either
   ``edx`` or ``https://www.facebook.com/edx``.

   For LinkedIn, note that your username might include numbers. For example,
   if the URL of your LinkedIn profile page is ``https://www.linkedin.com/in
   /firstname-lastname-123456/``, your LinkedIn username is ``firstname-
   lastname-123456``.

The site saves your changes when you click outside the text field.

When you view your profile, icons for the social media icons that you added
links for appear below your username. Other learners or course team members
can click those icons to visit your social media account page.

View Another Learner's Profile
================================

You can view other learners' profiles through their posts, responses, or
comments in course discussions.

#. On the **Discussion** page, select the username of any learner in a post, a
   response, or a comment.

   A page that displays the discussion activity only for the selected learner
   opens.

#. On the learner's **Discussion** page, select their linked username.

The learner's account profile page opens.
