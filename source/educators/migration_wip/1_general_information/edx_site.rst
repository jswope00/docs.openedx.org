The Open edX Site
***********************

The `Open edX Portal`_ is the destination for learning about hosting an Open
edX instance, extending the Open edX platform, and contributing to the Open edX project. In
addition, the Open edX site provides product announcements and other
community resources.

All users can view content on the Open edX site without creating an account
and logging in.

#. Under **Subscriptions**, select the different types of announcements that
   you want to receive through email. You might need to scroll down to see
   these options.
