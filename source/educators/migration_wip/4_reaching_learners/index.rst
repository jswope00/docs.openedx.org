The core mission of edX is to expand access to education for everyone. Keep in
mind that the courses and course content that you create should be accessible
to everyone, regardless of any physical limitation that they might have, and
regardless whether they are accessing your course using a Web browser or using
mobile apps.

For information about accessibility best practices, see :ref:`Accessibility
