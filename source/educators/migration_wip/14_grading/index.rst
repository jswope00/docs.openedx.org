Establishing a Grading Policy For Your Course
#############################################

course. Establishing a grading policy requires several steps, including
deciding whether to include ungraded sections in your course.

.. important:: Any changes to the course grading policy, to graded
 subsections, or to graded components after a course begins will affect the
 student experience in the course and analysis of its data.

For information on how to develop your course content in the Studio Outline,
