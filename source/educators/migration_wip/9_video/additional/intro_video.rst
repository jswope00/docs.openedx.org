Videos in a course supplement active learning components, such as discussions
and problems. Videos can be effective for presenting motivating material,
showing experiments, reducing cognitive load for complex content, and other
purposes.

When you create video content, you need to keep various guidelines in mind.
This section describes these guidelines, as well as video technical
specifications, how to add video content to your course, and how to specify
options for your videos.

For more information about how learners can interact with course videos, see
`Video Player`_.

.. important::

   It is very important that all of your videos are accessible to learners with
   disabilities. Be sure to review :ref:`Creating Accessible Media` before you
   create videos for your course.
